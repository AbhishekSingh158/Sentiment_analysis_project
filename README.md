# Sentiment_analysis_project
This project uses Python’s NLTK and TextBlob libraries to analyze the sentiment of text. It can tell if the text is positive, negative, or neutral. The project includes functions that use TextBlob’s polarity scores and custom word lists to detect sentiment. Users can input text to see the sentiment result.
